# Structural Completeness of Identity and Interaction under the Λ-Principle

## Abstract

We formalize the Nielsen--Semita Attractor Framework (NSAF) under the
Λ-Principle of Irreducibility, showing that identity, interaction, and
force-like phenomena emerge as artifacts of irreducible
description-length tradeoffs between linear (L) and curved (C) frames.
We prove a structural completeness theorem covering single-agent,
multi-agent, and n-agent systems, with 1/f spectra as the universal
equilibrium signature.

## Definitions

**Definition 1 (Λ-Principle).** No finite description simultaneously
minimizes length in both L and C frames.

**Definition 2 (Agent).** An agent is a linear-frame optimizer
maintaining a boundary separating associated (self) from dissociated
(environment) descriptions.

**Definition 3 (Boundary).** The irreducible interface across which
association/dissociation inverts at scale limits.

## Theorem 1 (Structural Completeness).

For any agent system (1, 2, or n agents), identity persistence,
interaction, and apparent forces arise as boundary-maintained artifacts
under Λ, and no further primitives are required.

## Corollaries

1.  Ship of Theseus persistence follows from boundary continuity under
    flow.
2.  Cooperation/competition correspond to phase alignment/misalignment.
3.  Learning equals boundary reclassification.
4.  1/f noise characterizes equilibrium across scales.

## Game-Theoretic Mapping

Agents optimize local compression; global dynamics converge to NSAF
attractors. Payoffs equal stability under irreducibility, not utility.

## Implications

This framework unifies physics, cognition, and social dynamics without
invoking fundamental observers or hidden variables.
